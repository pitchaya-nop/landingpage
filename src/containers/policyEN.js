                <p>We don't use your data to show you ads.</p>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
                    <li>We only store the data that GooChat needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>1.2. Terms of Service</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <a href="https://app.goochat.net/term/en">https://app.goochat.net/term/en</a> This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.</p>
                <h4>1.3. Table of Contents</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:</p>
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
                    <li>the legal basis for processing your personal data.</li>
                    <li>what personal data we may collect from you.</li>
                    <li>how we keep your personal data safe.</li>
                    <li>what we may use your personal data for.</li>
                    <li>who your personal data may be shared with.</li>
                    <li>your rights regarding your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)</em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and <em>(2)</em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p>
                <h3>3. What Personal Data We Use</h3>
                <h4>3.1. Basic Account Data</h4>
                <p>GooChat is a communication service. You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a GooChat account.</p>
                <p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on GooChat are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.</p>
                <p>We do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).</p>
                <h4>3.2. Your E-mail Address</h4>
                <p>When you enable email sign in You can choose to set up a password recovery email. This address will be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or nonsense. "We miss you"</p>
                <h4>3.3. Your Messages</h4>
                <h5>3.3.1. Cloud Chats</h5>

                <p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the approximate number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on GooChat. When you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining GooChat.</p>
                <p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt; Contact</p>
